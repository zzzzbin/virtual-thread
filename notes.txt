### Java Threads
Thread(Platform Thread) = OS Thread
Virtual Thread
### Virtual Thread
It will look like a thread
but OS cannot see them/ schedule them
### Stack Size
Platform threads have fixed stack
Virtual Threads do NOT have fixed stack. They have resizable stack
class VirtualThread{
    Runnable task;
    VirtualStack stack;
}
