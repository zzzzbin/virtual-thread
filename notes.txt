### Java Threads
Thread(Platform Thread) = OS Thread
Virtual Thread
### Virtual Thread
It will look like a thread
but OS cannot see them/ schedule them
### Stack Size
Platform threads have fixed stack
Virtual Threads do NOT have fixed stack. They have resizable stack
class VirtualThread{
    Runnable task;
    VirtualStack stack;
}
### Virtual Thread Scheduler
Platform Threads are scheduled by the OS scheduler
Virtual Threads are scheduled by JVM (ForkJoinPool)
- core pool size = available processor
- Carrier threads will NOT be blocked during I/O
### Scheduling types
Preemptive: OS scheduling policy, CPU is allocated for a limited time, context switching
Cooperative: CPU is allocated till the execution is completed. If there is a long running thread/task, other thread might have to starve
How to implement Cooperative? Thread.yield
